# Mythe2019

Main repo: https://github.com/ThomasGITH/Mythe---project

A project dedicated to different heroes or villains from any mythology.

We chose a myth called; "Hel". 
Hel is basically the Grim Reaper from the viking times. She was the one who chooses if someone goes to Hellheim or to Vallhalla.

# Process and Production

This was probably the biggest project that I've partaken in yet.

We started this project not knowing what we would be getting into, as none of us had that much knowledge on mythology, so we started browsing the web for interesting mythologies. Eventually we stumbled upon Hel, and most of the people in the group liked it, so we continued to brain storm about what we could make with this mythological creature. First, we had the idea to make a hack and slash type of game, but realised that it would be too big, so we scrapped it and went for the idea of making an endless runner on Android instead.

# 1st sprint

As soon as we got to work, we started to think of what needs to be made, to make a working prototype. This included the testing of the Andriod .APK.
