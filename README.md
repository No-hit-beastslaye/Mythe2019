# Mythe2019

Main repo: https://github.com/ThomasGITH/Mythe---project

A project dedicated to different heroes or villains from any mythology.

We chose a myth called; "Hel". 
Hel is basically the Grim Reaper from the viking times. She was the one who chooses if someone goes to Hellheim or to Vallhalla.

# Process and Production

This was probably the biggest project that I've partaken in yet.

We started this project not knowing what we would be getting into, as none of us had that much knowledge on mythology, so we started browsing the web for interesting mythologies. Eventually we stumbled upon Hel, and most of the people in the group liked it, so we continued to brain storm about what we could make with this mythological creature. First, we had the idea to make a hack and slash type of game, but realised that it would be too big, so we scrapped it and went for the idea of making an endless runner on Android instead.

# 1st sprint

As soon as we got to work, we started to think of what needs to be made, to make a working prototype. This included the testing of the Andriod .APK. Thanks to daily stands ups, we kept in touch with each other, and were able to document everything that we were doing, and ask questions about what a person was doing. At the end of this sprint, we evaluated what we did during this sprint, as a heads up for the next sprint.

# 2nd sprint

After previous' sprint evaluation, we shed some light on whether we thought some of the core features that were in the prototype were good enough or not, and get back to work. All of us ran into some problems with github and some of the scripts that we imported from each other. These problems were fixed quite fast, and we continued on with our work. In this sprint, we even had a mobile prototype running. In this sprint, we also evaluated and reflected back on what we did during this sprint.

# 3rd Sprint

In the last sprint, we aimed to polish everything that we had, and create a boss mechanic and some parallax. We also ran into major performance issues thanks to that, so we ended up scrapping some of it. Furthermore, we also did a user test, to see how a few people would find the game, and thanks to their feedback, we realised that we made the game too hard, and made the game a lot easier. After the last sprint, we evaluated it for the last time, to see what we could learn from what we made.

# Reflection

Looking back on this project, I learnt a lot. For example, I learnt that you can't rush designing concepts, you have to think about a lot if you want to make a good concept, for example, if you make a shooter, and there are no enemies, what's the point of the shooter? Or what happens when you run out of ammo? Etc etc. And that if you're thinking of releasing something on a different platform, that you need to pay attention to how optimised something is, as it might not run on other devices. It also taught me to keep communicating throughout the daily stand ups, it makes it easier for people to talk about what kind of issues they have, and allows them to be helped if necessary.
